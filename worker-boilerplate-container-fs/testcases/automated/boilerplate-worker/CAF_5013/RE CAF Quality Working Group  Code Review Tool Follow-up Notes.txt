I agree with Dermot, once we open source a component it should be
treated like any other third party component and use the most
appropriate publically accessible tools. What are the requirements for
auditable code review for third party open source components? 

 

BTW

I think when Dermot says IDM are using keycloak on github.com he means
the opensource project https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak. All I knew
of in TF was the modified docker container.

I agree with Dermot: integration with Jira should not be an concern
based on previous experience with other open source projects on the
internet today. (Jenkins own project for example uses, Jira and
Confluence integrated nicely ).  https://jenkins.io/

 

But I think in order to answer this question, it begs answer to the
underlying question about staying with Jira, or switching to GitHub’s
internal tool.  I’d also like to hear what Krzystof’s plans are.

 

Lastly, IDM is using keycloak that was checked into TF git, not the one
from GitHub (for clarification), unless they changed something that I
was unaware of…

Hi Chris,

 

I can’t answer all your questions but I’ll take a stab at it.

 

The public/private on GitHub Enterprise is still just within the HPE –
i.e. if we set a CAF repository to private then only CAF Team Members
will be able to see it whereas if it is public then anybody on the HPE
network can see it (though they wouldn’t access to it, at least by
default).

 

Krzystof will be doing the open-source planning so perhaps he can (or
will be able to) shed more light on it but I would have thought that
open-sourcing a project would mean moving it to GitHub.com.  Any
projects that we move to GitHub.com would obviously be standalone, and
that would be the only place that they would be pulled from – they
wouldn’t be pulled from two places.  If we then use some of these
components within our private repositories then it would be much the
same as using any other external dependency – such as the way the IDM
team use KeyCloak, which is hosted on GitHub.com.  I would assume that
we would use the same code review process for our contributions as we
would expect external contributors to use, as I don’t see why we would
be happy for the code to be public but not the code review comments, but
I could be wrong, others may have different views on that.

 

I’m not sure about the auditable code review trail, I guess that is one
of the questions that Krzystof will need to answer.  Or if it’s a legal
thing then maybe it only applies to a sensitive projects that we’re not
open-sourcing – I don’t really know.

 

With regard to defect tracking, again this is something that will need
to be planned but I know many open-source projects use public JIRA
instances and others use GitHub’s internal bug reporting tool – either
seem like reasonable options to me as you can cross-reference both in
both directions.

 

Thanks,

Dermot

Forgive my ignorance, but I wasn’t aware that deciding to open source
pieces in the future would require us to break up our code into separate
source repositories. I thought Github Enterprise allowed you to set
individual repos as either public/private and set appropriate access
controls. Could someone please explain how this would work if we go down
this path? 

 

If we have to pull from more than one location, then an additional tool
outside of Github that can handle multiple repos would be better It can
pull everything together into code reviews that logically make sense and
like Tony . Depending on what certifications we may be thinking about in
the future, having an auditable code review trail may be a requirement
and I’m not sure what options would be available if we had to solely
rely on Github.com to produce pieces of this information.  Public Github
would also mean potentially splitting up defect tracking, work/tasks,
etc. and could limit how we integrate so it has other implications. 

 

I would really like to see us figure out #1. Having tasks integrated
check-ins integrated with code review integrated with test cases and
(hopefully not too frequently) integrated with defects is very useful.

 

#2 will become important as soon as we seek a certification that
requires auditable code review trails.

Dermot:

I wasn’t in the call either.  And yes, you are confirming my point
exactly:  

 

Code review will have two different paths, if we do what you are
suggesting, not a single instance like it could be with one of the other
tools.  Additionally you are at the mercy of “public” GitHub (not the
HPE instance) for any storage (or loss thereof) of past reviews.

 

The goal of all of these tool and infrastructure changes was “single”
implementation (or at least that has been the driving justification I
have heard).  My standpoint is that we are immediately in violation of
that by switching to process or tools that by default is contrary to
that charter ( in this case we are knowingly forcing reviews in two
separate locations)…

 

There is a reason, that tools like Code Collaborator and Crucible are
paid, the features are typically far more mature and reliable (I know
everyone knows this, but I’m restating for emphasis of consideration).
I’d hate to see us not truly do a spreadsheet comparison of those
features , and possibly risk productivity, because the latest trend is
smashing everything into GitHub.

 

 

All:

My other question stands, is items 1 and 2 make or break ?

 

Thanks,

Hi Tony,

 

I wasn’t in yesterday’s meeting but I would have thought the fact that
we have to open source some of our components (we have to start to plan
open-sourcing worker framework next week) almost forces us down the
GitHub route.  We would obviously move the components we are
open-souring from GitHub Enterprise to GitHub.com, but we would have to
expect external contributors to submit code for consideration using the
standard mechanism used with all other GitHub.com projects.

 

Thanks,

Dermot

Presumably you have also thought about what happens when some amount of
the source code is open sourced, and you now have to use multiple
locations to access your source control tools (code review and other ?)

Gerrit, Code Collaborator, and Crucible are nice because they allow you
to support any repository type in one instance, one location…  And you
can now query across repositories, report across repositories etc.
Currently not an option with separate instances of Git Hub.

Is items 1 and 2 (in the action items), make or break concerns, or just
nice to have ?

Subject: CAF Quality Working Group : Code Review Tool Follow-up Notes

Greetings All,

Yesterday, a smaller group got together and discussed the possible
tools that could be used for Code Reviews.

We discussed:

*       GitHub Pull Requests

*       Crucible

*       Gerrit

*       Code Collaborator

We saw demos of most of the tools and their capabilities. 

This sub team would like to propose using the integrated GitHub Pull
Requests to address code reviews.

Two concerns/actions were raised:

1.      Need to complete JIRA integration so that the code review can
be linked seamlessly to JIRA work/bug tickets.

2.      Need to investigate Metrics/audit trail collection data to
ensure that code review evidential persist and can be queried.

Let’s circle back in the next workgroup meeting to follow up.

Regards,

Darin
